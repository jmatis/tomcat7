tomcat7
=======

depends on jmatis/java
tomcat 7.0.53 installed in /opt/tomcat with startscript /opt/start-watch-tomcat.sh

I recommend to run it with run.sh from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmatis/tomcat7/master/run.sh

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmatis/tomcat7/master/run.sh
chmod 750 run.sh
./run.sh

&gt;ctrl&lt;-&gt;c&lt; after finished watching catalina.out (container will continue to run)
